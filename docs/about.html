I love the outdoors. I am a member of The Mountaineers based in Seattle. I've learned so much about nature through the organization, and I owe it to them for getting me started in my pursuit and love of nature and nature photography.<br><br>I've taken courses in alpine scrambling, basic snowshoeing, navigation, and avalanche awareness. I am also certified in Wilderness First Aid by Remote Medical International. Being able to receive instruction and guidance in these subjects from mountaineers who are experienced in outdoor travel and safety has allowed me to build a greater appreciation of and respect for the outdoors.<br><br>I hope to continue exploring the beautiful Pacific Northwest and am excited to share the experience with you by displaying my photography and trip details here.<br><br>Enjoy, and happy trails!</p></div></main><footer class="about-footer">made with&emsp;<i class="fa fa-tree" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-tree fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-tree" aria-hidden="true"></i> &emsp;by dddotcom&emsp; Â© 2017 All Rights Reserved.</footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="main.js"></script></body></html>
